This project is part of an academic assignment for the "Usability & User Experience Design (2023-2024)" course, led by Professor Fabio Vitali. Our primary focus is on the redesign of the website https://dallasflowerflorist.com/ind.html. The existing website has been identified as lacking in user-friendly interfaces, prompting our initiative to enhance its usability. Our redesign approach is committed to delivering a significantly improved user-friendly experience, ensuring that the interface is both intuitive and accessible. This endeavor not only aims to meet but exceed user expectations, providing a seamless and engaging online interaction. Below is the link to access the presentation for our project explaning the whole process.
